**Flutter Project for Smart Antimicrobial Use in Livestock**

## Overview

Improper antimicrobial use in livestock leads to food residues, driving antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and threatening global public health. **pashuseva** is a mobile application designed to address the PS: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for Monitoring Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) and Antimicrobial Usage (AMU) in Livestock.

This app integrates AI/ML-powered insights, multilingual support, encrypted traceability, and real-time compliance tracking, creating a unified solution for sustainable livestock farming and safer food supply.
